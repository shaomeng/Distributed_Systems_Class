\begin{abstract}
File systems are a crutial component of supercomputers.
%
Often, file system of a supercomputer consists of many file servers
to provide capacity, reliability, redundency, and consistency
required by a supercomputer.
%
These file servers are organized as a distributed system
to provide functionalities of a file system.
%
A distributed file system can have several performance challenges,
due to the distributed nature of the file system itself,
and the high concurrency nature of the supercomputer system.
%
This survey paper studies performance issues of two most widely 
used file systems: Lustre and GPFS.
%
The scope of performance issues include identificatino of bottlenecks
and best approaches to minimize impact of these bottlenecks.
