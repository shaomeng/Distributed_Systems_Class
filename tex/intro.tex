This survey paper identifies common performance issues in 
the distributed file systems, 
and explores approaches to minimize impacts of these issues.
%
This survey specifically looks into three popular distributed 
file systems: Lustre, GPFS, and Google File System.
%
Lustre~\cite{Schwan2003} is open-sourced and powers many of the 
world's fastest supercomputers.
%
GPFS~\cite{Schmuck2002}\cite{barkes1998gpfs} is a proprietary system owned by IBM, and
it also powers many supercomputers.
%
Google File System~\cite{ghemawat2003google} is designed by Google and used 
exclusively by Google.
%
Due to the difference in public availability of these three systems,
Lustre is most intensively studied by researchers, 
and Google File System has least amount of public research results.
